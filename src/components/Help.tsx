              This is a visualization of bots learning how to play the classic game of{" "}
              <span className="bold">Snake</span> via <span className="bold">Neuroevolution</span>.
              You&apos;ll notice that there are multiple snakes on screen. That&apos;s due to the
              nature of the neuroevolution algorithm, inspired by Darwin&apos;s theory of evolution.
              Although snakes play the game independently from each other, they are part of a
              competing population, following the concept of{" "}
              <span className="bold">survival of the fittest</span>. Each snake has its own way of
              playing the game, and the better they are at it, the more likely they and their
              offspring are to advance to the next <span className="bold">generation</span> (i.e.
              the next game). Similarly, snakes that do not perform well are gradually eliminated
              from the population. As generations progress, the score of the population tends to
              improve, allowing us to discover (hopefully) good strategies for playing the game,
              even if not optimal.

                <li>The goal is to get as many diamonds as possible, each awarding 1 point.</li>

                  Snakes do not collide with each other and can only collect their own diamonds.
